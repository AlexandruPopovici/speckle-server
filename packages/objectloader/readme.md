## Getting started

This is a small utility class that helps you stream an object and all its sub-components from the Speckle Server API. It is inteded to be used in contexts where you want to "download" the whole object, or iteratively traverse its whole tree.

Here's a sample way on how to use it, pfilfered from the [3d viewer package](../viewer):

```js


async load( { serverUrl, token, streamId, objectId } ) {

  const loader = new ObjectLoader( { serverUrl, token, streamId, objectId } )

  let total = null
  let count = 0

  for await ( let obj of loader.getObjectIterator() ) {

    if( !total ) total = obj.totalChildrenCount

    console.log( obj, `Progress: ${count++}/${total}` )

  }

}

```
